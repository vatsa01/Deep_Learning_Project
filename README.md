# GTSRB Traffic Sign Classification

Traffic sign classification is a crucial component for the development of autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems.
This repository provides a solution to classify traffic signs from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying traffic signs. 
The GTSRB dataset is utilized, which consists of over 50,000 images spanning 43 different traffic signs.

## Dataset Description

The GTSRB dataset encompasses images of traffic signs across 43 different classes. 
The images present a variety in terms of brightness, size, and occlusion.
